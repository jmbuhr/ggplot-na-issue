# Solved

For future reference:

It was problem with the matrix multiplication in ggplot2.

One workstation (that produced random outputs) was using Intels mkl math libraries,
while all the others that didn't have the issue where using openblas.

Check with `sessionInfo()` in R and then fix in the linux command line with

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --config libblas.so.3-x86_64-linux-gnu
sudo update-alternatives --config liblapack.so.3-x86_64-linux-gnu
```
